# Closet Inclusivity

Created a virtual fitting room to fit clothing items on a model image, and developed a webpage demo that demonstrates how this functionality could be integrated into the Aritzia website for a seamless e-commerce experience.

Built using an image manipulation program written in C++ and a demo webpage written in JavaScript and HTML/CSS.
